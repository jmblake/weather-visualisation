# weather-visualisation
Work from the technical portion of an interview process from July 2020. 

The reproducability of this project is limited, given that I have not provided the full json that was used to generate the plots. This is a considered decision, with the intention of respecting the privacy of the company to which this piece of work pertained. As a compromise, I have included a very small snippet of the json that was used, in order to give an flavour of the data schema; the complete json file was about 2GB. There is also an HTML version of the notebook available, which shows the plots that were generated.
